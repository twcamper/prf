Usage Note: Don't use FILENAME_MAX as the size of an array in which to store a file name! You can't possibly make an array that big! Use dynamic allocation (see Memory Allocation) instead.

Error message module
    refactor out all the duplicate error messages

make install target

Note libFLAC installation woes somewhere:
    on Snow Leopard:
        homebrew built for wrong architecture, or something (linker
        errors)

        so, had to build from source:
            $ ./configure CC=clang --disable-asm-optimizations
            $ make
            $ make install

        install failed!  but I was able to manually install the headers
        and libs:

            $ cd ~/Downloads/flac-1.2.1/
            $ find . -type f -name '*.dylib'
            $ cd src/libFLAC/.libs
            $ cp libFLAC.* /usr/local/lib/
            $ cd ~/Downloads/flac-1.2.1/
            $ cd include
            $ cp FLAC/*.h /usr/local/include/FLAC/
